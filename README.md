## Stat 545b Assignment 1

The purpose of this assignment was to practice creating a function using function() in R. Packages **tidyverse** **testthat** **palmerpenguins** and **gapminder** are required to be able to successfully run the code produced in this assignment. For this project, I made a function that creates a residual plot for a linear model with one explantory and one response variable.

### Files
For this project, I have created and edited the following files:
* B1.Rmd This is the original R markdown file I created and edited for this project.
* B1.md This is the markdown file knitted from B1.Rmd which can be viewed in github
* README.md This is the readme file
